##Iterate, analyze, improve.
Use the chatbot to reshape your facade mask in seconds—then run a GPT-powered Professional Analysis to see exactly how each change impacts daylight, rhythm, and thermal comfort. Repeat the loop to quickly converge on a better design.

Option B — benefits first

Design smarter with AI.
Edit your SVG facade interactively, and after each revision, get an instant, GPT-driven report on window-to-wall ratio, visual rhythm, and performance. Iterate with clear metrics and watch your design measurably improve.

##From idea to insight—fast.
Make a change, run Professional Analysis, and immediately see how it affects daylighting, efficiency, and aesthetics. The chatbot guides edits; the analysis quantifies impact—so every iteration moves your facade forward.
Refine your facade with AI, then validate every tweak with GPT-powered analysis. Edit, analyze, repeat—until the metrics and the design align.

##AI-assisted facade optimization
Edit the SVG mask through natural language.
Run GPT-based Professional Analysis after each change.
Track daylight, thermal, and visual metrics to steer rapid, data-driven iterations.
